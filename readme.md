# Incremancer Save Editor
### i used python btw

# this does not actually work right now
<p>i dont know how to get the save editing part working.</p>
<p>for now just use dump.py, edit it in notepad, and use dump.py again.</p>

```
./dump.py decode input.sav output.json -b
notepad output.json
./dump.py encode output.json output.sav
```

# requirements
the only thing you actually need to install is the lzstring library.
```
pip install lzstring
```

### idk what to name this section
but anyways this entire thing wouldnt be possible without incremancer existing
