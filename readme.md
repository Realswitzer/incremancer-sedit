# Incremancer Save Editor

### i used python btw

<p>oh yeah i also made one of the worst code samples. feel free to use as an example of flat out terrible code.</p>

# this does not work well

<p>it sorta works. to just decompress the save so you can see inside of it, use dump.py</p>

```
./dump.py decode input.sav output.json -b
notepad output.json
./dump.py encode output.json output.sav
```

# heres a demo

# requirements

you need to install lzstring and fuckit.
<p>lzstring -> decompress save file and compress it</p>

<p>fuckit -> try/except didnt work for eval and exec so...yeah.</p>

<p>numpy -> idk handle [x,...,y]</p>

<p>pyperclip -> not used in final thing but used for debugging. i left the code in because im lazy so until the "final" release is made itll be listed.</p>

```
pip install lzstring
pip install fuckit
pip install numpy
```

### idk what to name this section
but anyways this entire thing wouldnt be possible without incremancer existing
