# Incremancer Save Editor

### i used python btw

<p>oh yeah i also made one of the worst code samples. feel free to use as an example of flat out terrible code.</p>

# this works slightly better than when i last changed this text

<p>it sorta works. to just decompress the save so you can see inside of it, use dump.py</p>

```
./dump.py decode input.sav output.json -b
notepad output.json
./dump.py encode output.json output.sav
```

<p>this is not guaranteed to work on chalice12's mod, use dump.py and manually edit it. while from my short testing you can take a normal save, edit it, and put it into chalice's mod, i am unable to fully test backwards compatability so you may lose some things.</p>

# heres a demo

# requirements
you need to install lzstring, fuckit, and numpy.

|package|arrow|reason|
|-|-|-|
|lzstring|->|decompress save file and compress it|
|fuckit|->|make eval and exec not explode|
|numpy|->|idk handle [x,...,y]

<p>here is code for you to run :) trust</p>

```sh
pip install lzstring fuckit numpy
```

### idk what to name this section
but anyways this entire thing wouldnt be possible without incremancer existing
