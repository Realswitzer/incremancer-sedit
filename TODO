-add editing support for levels (vipescaped,levelscompleted,trophies)
-add editing support for upgrades (likely by way of mapping, i.e. "Bloodthirst" maps to id 1 (assuming bloodthirst is 1))
-add editing support for items (need further reverse engineering to figure out what the hell im doing)
-add semicolons to run multiple edits by typing a massive line (key1 = val1; key2 = val2)
-possibly add +=, -=, = opts for levels
  Example of =
  > vipEscaped = []

  Example of +=
  > !view levelsCompleted
  [1, 2, 3, ..., 356, 357, 358]
  > levelsCompleted += [358,...1000]
  Key edited
  > !view levelsCompleted
  [1, 2, 3, ..., 998, 999, 1000]

  Example of -=
  > levelsCompleted -= [358,...1000]
  Key edited
  > !view levelsCompleted
  [1, 2, 3, ..., 356, 357, 358]
- finish reverse engineering (id)
- maybe preset-esque things? like "
    > !preset maxresources
    Keys edited
  "
  and in maxresources.(whatever extension is used):
    blood = null; brains = null; bones = null; parts = null; bonesTotal = null)
  i guess?
- suggest similar named keys (i.e. typing bonws will suggest bones)
