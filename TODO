- add editing support for items (need further reverse engineering to figure out what the hell im doing)
- possibly add +=, -=, = opts
  get -= working with lists. cant find any methods.
- suggest similar named keys (i.e. typing bonws will suggest bones)
- optimize this. sorry sov :(
- figure out how to reduce the amount of if statements
- dedupe: fix manual list insertion
  > !view trophies;trophies = [0,5,10,15,20];/dedupe trophies
  Running concatenated cmd
  [10, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, ...]
  Key edited / (['trophies']) -> "[0,5,10,15,20]"
  Deduped ['trophies']
  ['[', '0', ',', '5', '1', '2', ']']

- make -c/--overwrite arg do something
- check if output file already exists to prevent issues.
- make better garbage collection? if possible?
- convert to switch statements
- remove useless commands
- maybe edit by id
- make it conform to pep8 i guess.
- remake /:3
