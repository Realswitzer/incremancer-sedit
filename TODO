-add editing support for upgrades (likely by way of mapping, i.e. "Bloodthirst" maps to id 1)
-add editing support for items (need further reverse engineering to figure out what the hell im doing)
-possibly add +=, -=, = opts
-clear/cls command to make screen prettier
  get -= working with lists. cant find any methods.
- maybe preset-esque things? like "
    > !preset maxresources
    Keys edited
  "
  and in maxresources.(whatever extension is used):
    blood = null; brains = null; bones = null; parts = null; bonesTotal = null)
  i guess?
- suggest similar named keys (i.e. typing bonws will suggest bones)
- optimize this. sorry sov :(
- figure out how to reduce the amount of if statements
- dedupe: fix manual list insertion
  > !view trophies;trophies = [0,5,10,15,20];/dedupe trophies
  Running concatenated cmd
  [10, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, ...]
  Key edited / (['trophies']) -> "[0,5,10,15,20]"
  Deduped ['trophies']
  ['[', '0', ',', '5', '1', '2', ']']
