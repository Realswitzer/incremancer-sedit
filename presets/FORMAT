All editor commands in presets use /, this is to ensure consistency if someone
decides to change their command prefixes.
Everything is on a single line.
All commands are seperated by semicolons (spaces behind and after are
optional), i.e.
blood = 10;brains = 10;/upg bloodthirst 2000;/save;/exit

The program looks in /presets/ and if no extension is provided in the user
input,the default extension is .sep (saveedit preset) though really any
extension works as long as there is one.

Comments in the preset file should be on line two and after. Sorry.
Feel free to file complaints on the github repository.

KNOWN BUGS: When bulk editing keys, it doesn't show "Key edited / (key) -> val".
This is visual and the keys are still modified.
